        <p className="about__description-1">I am Pat Thomas owner of SimProdos
            (Simple, Productive, Organizing, Solutions).
            Over the years I managed to turn my dream into
            a goal, and my goal into a reality.
            SimProdos is that reality.
        </p>
        <p className="about__description-2">SimProdos is geared to finding the best solution to
            organizing problems whether it is objects, digital
            info, or time management. My focus is helping people.
            I enjoy assisting clients to unclutter, de-stress and
            create a system that works for them. No matter
            what the project involves: cleaning, moving and
            storage, or planning. My joy is aiding them
            intangible ways.
        </p>
        <p className="about__description-3">Together, we make dreams, goals,
            and goals a reality.
